Channels
========

When installed in a Plone site, `collective.dancing` will install a
channel container and a list of `IChannel` objects in it.

  >>> from zope import component
  >>> from zope.app.component.hooks import setSite
  >>> setSite(self.portal)

The registered `IChannelLookup` utility will give us a list of all
channels in the site:

  >>> from collective.singing.interfaces import IChannelLookup
  >>> component.getUtility(IChannelLookup)()
  []

Let's create a channel and ask for the list of channels again:

  >>> from collective.dancing.channel import Channel
  >>> channels = self.portal['portal_newsletters']['channels']
  >>> channels['c1'] = Channel('c1')
  >>> component.getUtility(IChannelLookup)()
  [<Channel at /plone/portal_newsletters/channels/c1>]
