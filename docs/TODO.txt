- We need to implement a secure secret hash.  An unsecure hash is
  generated right now in ``collective.dancing.composer``.

- We want a page that allows subscribing to any of the channels at
  once.

- We need to test the queue and see after how many messages it makes
  sense to commit back.  The relevant code is in
  ``collective.singing.message``.

- We need a convenient way of calling each scheduler's ``tick`` and
  the queues' ``dispatch`` methods periodically.
