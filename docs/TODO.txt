High priority
=============

- My subscriptions page for users; including add, remove and edit
  subscriptions.  We'll need to add a catalog for subscriptions for
  that. (tmog)

- We want persistent composers where one can edit the template that's
  used for sending out the message. (nouri)

- We need to implement a secure secret hash.  An unsecure hash is
  generated right now in ``collective.dancing.composer``. (nouri)

- Figure out issue with ZODB3 and fakezope2eggs. (nouri)

- Help texts for the management screens. (stonor)

Medium priority
===============

- A plain text composer plus template.

- The collector needs to be clever about caching results.

- We need to test the queue and see after how many messages it makes
  sense to commit back.  The relevant code is in
  ``collective.singing.message``.

- We need a convenient way of calling each scheduler's ``tick`` and
  the queues' ``dispatch`` methods periodically.
